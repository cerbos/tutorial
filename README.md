# Cerbos Tutorials

'Cerbforce' is the new killer CRM system that is taking the world by storm. It began as a small SaaS application that has grown into an enterprise-scale, multi-tenant, global powerhouse.

It is now at the point where the existing basic permission model created at the start of development is no longer fit for purpose and Cerbos has been selected as the system to implement.

This tutorial will walk through the decision-making process for implementing Cerbos. It will cover setting up, defining the various resources and policies for the different objects and users in the system, and evolve them to make use of all of Cerbos' features.
